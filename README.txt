The Ambidex Game, or A/B Game, is a numbers game of trust and betrayal. Have you ever heard of the prisoner's dilemma? Well, this game revolves around that as a core gameplay mechanic.

There are 9 players within the A/B Game, and each one starts with 3 BP, or Bracelet Points. The overall goal of the game is to reach 9 points and leave the game. The players are assigned into 6 groups: 3 PAIRs and 3 SOLOs. Each one is also assigned a color of Red, Green or Blue. So, in total, there is a Red Solo, Red Pair, Blue Solo, Blue Pair, Green Solo, and Green Pair.


After the teams are laid out and assigned, the pairs and solos will be pitted against each other as opponents! Each PAIR and SOLO can choose to Ally with their opponent, or Betray them.

If both the PAIR and SOLO ally, they each gain 2 BP.
If the PAIR Allys and the SOLO Betrays, the SOLO gains 3 points while the members of the PAIR lose 2 points, and vice-versa."
If both the PAIR and the SOLO decide to Betray, their scores don’t change.
                  
After that, the scores are calculated and displayed to everybody. Anyone at or below 0 BP during this time... will perish! (Dead peoples votes will default to Ally.)
